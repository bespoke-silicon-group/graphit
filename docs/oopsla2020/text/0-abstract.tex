\begin{abstract}

\noindent We present a compiler for graph workloads targeting the HammerBlade manycore chip. 
We explore two parallel execution models; one, similar to the GPU model, that relies on host coordination, and one that elects a leader core to disperse and assign tasks to worker cores. We evaluate the performance and energy savings of these two execution models on our HammerbBlade manycore architecture.
